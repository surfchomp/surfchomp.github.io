        <h3>Find a store close by:</h3>
        <p> This can play a huge role in a surfing trip. It doesn't need to be a surfshop, conveinience stores can carry products that can help you out in a bind. For example if you have a soft top board and you accidentaly punctured it you could run over to the store and buy some tape as a temporary fix.</p>
        <h3>Get a surfboard sleeve:</h3>
        <p> If you carry your board on the inside of your vehicle it can protect the cloth or leather seats. If you carry your board on the outside it can protect the paint.</p>
        <h3>Don't act tough:</h3>
        <p> If you are feeling cold it is a good idea to hop out. Frostbite is dangerous painful and can effect anyone reardless of skill level.</p>
        <h3>Wear a wetsuit:</h3>
        <p> Even if your have a high tolerence to cold, a wetsuit can keep you warmer which can lead to longer more enjoyable surf sessions.</p>
